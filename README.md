👋 Hello, I'm Siemhong EM — Full-Stack Developer & Trainer at PSE (Cambodia)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Siemhong, a Cambodian web and mobile app developer with nearly a decade of experience. I’m currently a trainer at Pour un Sourire d’Enfant (PSE) — one of the top NGOs in Cambodia — where I help students transform their lives through technology.
🧑‍🏫 What I’m Doing Now

I’m currently focusing on Year 1 training, where I teach five foundational skills based on the Simplon pedagogy, all at Level 1:

    C1: Set up and configure the development environment

    C2: Mock up user interfaces

    C3: Create static user interfaces

    C4: Develop dynamic elements in a user interface

    C5: Implement a relational database

I guide students as they imitate and reproduce real-world projects, helping them build solid technical foundations.
🌟 What I’m Passionate About

Although I have experience in the full stack — frontend, backend, databases, and DevOps — I’m now focused on sharing and teaching:

    🎨 Front-end & UX/UI

    🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

I'm especially passionate about learning AI and using it to improve education, knowledge sharing, and community impact in Cambodia.
🔧 Tools and Skills I Use

    Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL

    Frameworks: React, NestJS, Express

    Databases: PostgreSQL

    Tools: GitHub, Docker, Vercel, pgAdmin

    Design: Figma, Tailwind CSS

    Learning Now: OpenAI tools, LangChain, and more AI technologies

🌱 Lifelong Learner

I believe in using technology not just to build products — but to build people. Whether it's creating learning tools, sharing resources, or exploring AI to solve local problems, I'm always learning — and sharing what I learn.
